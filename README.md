# Fun Time Simulator (WIP)
A simulator for the Jevil bossfight in Deltarune. Undertale and Deltarune belong to Toby Fox; I claim nothing.<br>
See what's already done <a href="https://krlw890.github.io/jevil-simulator/Jevil's%20Fun%20Time.html">here</a>.

<br>

For those interested in helping with this project, here are the details:

 ~ Programming:<br>
What I have so far is entirely HTML and JavaScript (mainly JS). I'm reluctantly willing to inplement other languages compatible with HTML that you're more proficient in, but I would prefer to stick with HTML/JS (and in any case, I plan to do the bulk of the programming myself). I already have a decent amount of the framework laid out (for the party, anyway), but I haven't started working on Jevil at all yet. If anything, having someone else to help with a handful of Jevil's attacks would be appreciated.

 ~ Assets:<br>
This means images and sounds. I have no easy way of creating images with transparent backgrounds. In particular, the rotating background is something I would prefer help with. The simulator is using an HTML canvas, which doesn't support gifs, so all animations will need to be in the form of spritesheets with frames next to each other on a single row.<br>
As far as sounds go, I just need the sound effects, mp3 files are preferred, since Microsoft Edge doesn't support ogg.

 ~ Datamining:<br>
If possible, someone who can dig into the code of the original to pull out some numbers or formulas (ie, how many pixels does the player move per frame?) would be very appreciated.
